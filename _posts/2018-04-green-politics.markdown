What is the purpose of today's Green Parties?

1. Left and center-left parties in rich countries are almost uniform in their awareness of environmental issues and support of environmental protection. There is no anti-environment left. Awareness of environmental issues is high enough that this might even be said of the mainstream right. It's extremely rare for politicians to deny that environmental values are legitimate. Even fossil fuel interests couch their apologetics in the language of environmental protection, even when it takes the form of absurdities such as "clean coal."

2. Green parties always drift away from their more radical positions when they are close to power, further diluting whatever makes them distinct. Are they advocating for anything divorced from the standard left-right spectrum and, if not, what makes them necessary?

Answers:

Climate change remains a serious problem and mainstream parties have failed to produce a credible platform for addressing its consequences. The climate change platform of the Democratic Party in the US is illustrative: Outside of green politics, politicians talk about climate change as if it were mostly a matter of economic opportunity. If only we build more solar panels, or buy more hybrid vehicles, or invent more efficient batteries, the crisis will be solved. The idea that our present way of life is unsustainable without fossil fuels, and that inchoate technological innovation is not guaranteed to resolve this, is untouchable.
