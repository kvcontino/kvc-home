Scattered thoughts on the American political landscape in 2020, to be expanded on later.

<b>Democratic Losses in Rural Areas</b>

It's important to sort out what's happening in larger deindustrializing cities from the rural areas and small cities: The latter is a much larger difference and one that increasingly extends beyond white voters.

Even in the smallest towns, there is a limit to the drift imposed by institutions that hire people from college-educated and frequently non-local pools, e.g. as long as rural areas and small cities have schools, hospitals, social service offices, and so on, there is something to keep different kinds of people around. Only places where the culture shuts out mass media and physical or social distance shuts out big, modern institutions will lack for this.

Gareth Morgan's metaphor of organizations as "psychic prisons" is helpful here - even locals who never leave but who earn their livelihoods through employment attached to these institutions and occupations affiliated with them will find themselves caught up in their internal logic.

None of which is to suggest that people will have uniform opinions at the local district office, of course, but even in very red places you'll find more differences of opinion in these settings, however quietly expressed, and that reverberates through family and other relationships.

Where the Democratic Party has any real grip on white voters these days, it's because they've bought into the managerial logic of the modern organization, whether that's in the private sector or the public sector, and whatever they're selling: Fast food, MBAs, condos, hip replacements,etc. Everything that we've seen over the past decade points to the acceleration of this trend as the party's oldest members die off.

Unfortunately, I expect that the future is for rural people to become increasingly impoverished and politically irrelevant, much like the machines built around ethnic white neighborhood in major cities as they disappeared. This will look different on a map because of the nature of population dispersal, but the electoral effect will be similar enough. Also, the importance of this shouldn't be overstated: Both major parties have been essentially suburban in their bases and organization since the 1960s, whatever overwhelming strength they hold in urban centers or the urban periphery.

Moreover, the way of life in these places is incredibly our of step with the cultural and economic mainstream of major cities in a way that mass media tends to understate. Most journalists lack the imagination to think about it, and that becomes more true with every day as the profession degenerates into a glorified brand of social media celebrity. No one in the country is more out of place in the modern Democratic coalition than a rural or small town person with a livelihood that remains independent of the modern organization.

Rural Americans will continue to hold a subcultural influence out of proportion with their numbers because of the appeal of outsider cultures marketed to bored and mildly disaffected suburbanites, most of whom are so immersed in the Conversation that it impedes creative thinking. A propertied minority will remain rich or get richer because they own real things, unlike both their rural neighbors and the increadingly credentialed urban precariat. But the kind of scenario that actually reverses the flow of people and power to the metropolitan centers is hard to imagine short of something dramatic enough to be described in retrospect as a civilizational collapse. 

<b>The Role of Media</b>

Fifty years ago liberating oneself from "mind-destroying media" meant hauling out your television and throwing barbs at the daily newspaper. Today you would have to render yourself not just a weirdo in the eyes of others, but a semi-functional hermit. The tools for practicing politics at even the most localized levels are increasing bound up in Big Tech's manipulative revenue models, and the alternatives are atrophying.

It's common enough for people to critique this, but rarely in a way that goes far enough. The problems aren't a matter of disinformation or poor moderation, they're inherent to the medium. 

<b>Misplaced Priorities</b>

The greatest harm that Pelosi did to her caucus, and the greatest harm that Democrats did to their national messaging, was in failing to make clear that they are the party of economic relief.

Yes, McConnell's strategy was to make the Democrats look as bad as possible and Trump was impossible to work with. But the House leadership did themselves no favors. The message reaching the public from Democrats was simultaneously (A) Americans are suffering in unimaginable ways and (B) what the Republicans are offering isn't good enough for us.

There were other failures, but this is one that the party could have addressed by acting differently over the past couple of months.

Another thought: Whatever you think of exit polls, there's no way that Trump should have been tying Biden on the "cares about people like you" vote, especially after the past year. Something had to go very, very wrong for this to happen.
